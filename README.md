Coding a band website that mixes a touch of minimalism and brutalism. 

## Built With

- Jekyl

## Other accomplishments

- Was featured on [Brutalist Websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com/).

- Link to the website where it was featured including a short Q&A - [Wasted Wish](https://brutalistwebsites.com/wastedwish.com/). In the Q&A I mention that the website is one page but it ended up being two as well as including the blog content feature.
